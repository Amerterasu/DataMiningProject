# Yelp Me Yelp You
Using the Yelp dataset provided by the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge),
we analyze the sentiment and related statistics of user reviews. We look at how the sentiment rating of a user's review is correlated to the business. Specifically, we looked for relationships between the attributes associated with each business (does it have free wifi? a parking garage?) and reviews given by over 1 million users in 11 cities worldwide.
