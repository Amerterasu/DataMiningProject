%\begin{abstract}
%Multifrequency media access control has been well understood in
%general wireless ad hoc networks, while in wireless sensor networks,
%researchers still focus on single frequency solutions. In wireless
%sensor networks, each device is typically equipped with a single
%radio transceiver and applications adopt much smaller packet sizes
%compared to those in general wireless ad hoc networks. Hence, the
%multifrequency MAC protocols proposed for general wireless ad hoc
%networks are not suitable for wireless sensor network applications,
%which we further demonstrate through our simulation experiments. In
%this article, we propose MMSN, which takes advantage of
%multifrequency availability while, at the same time, takes into
%consideration the restrictions of wireless sensor networks. Through
%extensive experiments, MMSN exhibits the prominent ability to utilize
%parallel transmissions among neighboring nodes. When multiple physical
%frequencies are available, it also achieves increased energy
%efficiency, demonstrating the ability to work against radio
%interference and the tolerance to a wide range of measured time
%synchronization errors.
